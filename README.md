### Hi there, I am a noob programmer who who just graduated from Tech Elavator in Columbus, OH. I am a former middle school and high school teacher who is changing careers for ...reasons. I am looking forward to soaking up everything as I start this new path. If it relates to programming or anything IT, I am always looking to learn more about it. My current skill set is with basic webdevelopment (Java, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML) and Linux (Debian). I am currently investing in learning cybersecurity, AI, Rust, and Angular. My current side projects focus on creating tools for teachers and students using these various languages and skills. To communicate with me, please use teacherforge@gmail.com. Look forward to working in this new environment.
