### Hi there, I am a noob programmer who is finally going to bootcamp to learn how to code for real. I am a former middle school and high school teacher who is changing careers for ...reasons. I am looking forward to soaking up everything as I start this new path. If it relates to programming or anything IT, I am always looking to learn more about it. To communicate with me, please use teacherforge@gmail.com. Look forward to working in this new environment.
