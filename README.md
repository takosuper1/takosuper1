### MY TRANSITION TO PROGRAMMING
Hi there, I am a former middle school and high school teacher who just graduated from Tech Elavator in Columbus, OH. Even as a teacher before Tech Elevator, I started building productivity apps in Google Apps Scripts to assist me with my day to day work. Tech Elevator upskilled my programming, exposing me to OOP with Java, managing databases, and creating polished UIs. Since then, I have been soaking up everything I can and working on side projects to bolster my resume. I now have a website (https://teacher-forge.com) built using Angular and served on Google Firebase. 

### CURRENT PROJECTS
Currently, I am learning Rust and Python for two different projects: 
1) RUST API: I am writing an api using Rust that will connect to Clockify.io to update data on my site about my experience with certain technologies. 
2) DJANGO API: I am writing an api using Python for a freelance project with the local Columbus, OH chapter of FreeCodeCamp.org to connect and update their social media and website.
 
### MY PASSION
I love building things with code, espcially things that enhance my or someone else's workflow. I also love a challenge because I know that I will come out of it with valuable experience. One thing that I learned from my brother and from my time at Tech Elevator, there is nothing I cannot do when I 'put my nose to the grindstone'.
