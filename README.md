### Hi there, I am a former middle school and high school teacher who just graduated from Tech Elavator in Columbus, OH. Even as a teacher before Tech Elevator, I started building productivity apps in Google Apps Scripts to assist me with my day to day work. Tech Elevator upskilled my programming, exposing me to OOP with Java, managing databases, and creating polished UIs. Since then, I have been soaking up everything I can and working on side projects to bolster my resume. I now have a website (https://teacher-forge.com) built using Angular and served on Google Firebase. Currently, I am learning two new languages for two projects: Rust and Python. I am using Rust to write an API that will connect to Clockify.io to update data on my site about my experience with certain technologies. I am learning Python for a freelance project with the local Columbus, OH chapter of FreeCodeCamp.org. My To communicate with me, please use teacherforge@gmail.com. Look forward to working in this new environment.
